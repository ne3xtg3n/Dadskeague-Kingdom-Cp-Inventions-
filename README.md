# Safety Guidelines

- **PPE**: Wear gloves, safety glasses, hearing protection, hard hats.
- **Lifting**: Use forklifts/cranes for skids, walls, roof panels.
- **Electrical**: De-energize circuits during wiring; lockout/tagout.
- **Fall Protection**: Secure ladders for loft/rafter work; use harnesses on roof.
- **Transport**: Secure loose items (TV, bar glass), use lashing points.
- **Inspection**: Verify structural fasteners, electrical grounding before occupancy.

 **Underground Garage**
<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="1000015691" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68e550c7-f850-4f76-96bb-044e6d0acd4a" />

Designed with a full-width underground garage + art/wine staging level (beneath the main house and partially beneath the pool) changes the project’s bones. Below is a fully revised, build-ready GitHub repo you can copy/paste. I’ve integrated: car turntables with trickle-charging, a basement-wide gallery vault, elevator (3rd floor/mezz → basement), structural transfer slab under the pool, waterproofing “bathtub” spec, clean-agent fire suppression, ventilation, egress, and an updated budget to $3.3–$4.4M.
